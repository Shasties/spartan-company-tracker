Currently this is version 0.5.0. This supports only Achilles Helmet tracking and 8 of the 31 spartan commendations necessary.  
0.6.0 will support 31/31 Achilles Helmet commendations.  
0.7.0 to 0.9.9 will be reserved for various bug fixes.  
1.0.0 will support tracking for all Achilles Helmet + Armor progress.  
1.X.X will be reserved for various bug fixes and features.  
Eventually this cli tool will be incorporated by a webapp to make this more user friendly.
